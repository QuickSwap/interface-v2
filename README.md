## Accessing the QuickSwap Interface

To access the QuickSwap Interface, use an IPFS gateway link from the
[latest release](https://github.com/QuickSwap/interface-v2/releases/latest),
or visit [quickswap.exchange](https://quickswap.exchange).

The QuickSwap interface is hosted on IPFS in a decentralized manner. `quickswap.exchange` just holds a CNAME record to the Cloudflare IPFS gateway. You can use [any](https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/) public or private IPFS gateway supporting origin isolation to access QuickSwap interface if for some reason the Cloudflare gateway doesn't work for you

Just go to `<your favorite public ipfs gateway>/ipns/quickswap.exchange`

⚠️ Make sure the gateway supports origin isolation to avoid possible security issues: you should be redirected to URL that looks like `https://quickswap.exchange.<your gateway>`
