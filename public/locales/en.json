The User must personally review and authorize all transaction messages that the User wishes to send to the Blockchains; this requires the User to sign the relevant transaction message with a private cryptographic key inaccessible to the Site. The User-authorized message will then be broadcasted to the Validators of the Blockchains through the wallet application or device and the User may pay a network fee to have the Validators of the Blockchains apply the transaction message to the QuickSwap Smart Contract System and record the results on the Blockchains—resulting in a token transaction being completed on the Blockchains.",

The Site does not hold and cannot purchase, sell or trade any tokens.

In making such associations, the Site relies upon third-party resources which may not be accurate or may not conform to a given User’s expectations. Multiple smart contracts can utilize the same token name or token symbol as one another, meaning that the name or symbol of a token does not guarantee that it is the token desired by the User or generally associated with such name or symbol. Users must not rely on the name, symbol or branding of a token on the Site, but instead must examine the specific smart contract associated with the name, symbol or branding and confirm that the token accords with User’s expectations.",
