The Site aggregates and publishes publicly available information about the Blockchains and the QuickSwap Smart Contract System in a user-friendly and convenient format. Such information is also independently available from other sources—for example, a person may directly review the Blockchains transaction history, account balances and the QuickSwap Smart Contract System on a Polygon or an Ethereum block explorer.",
  "relationshipQuickswapSmartContractText2": "By combining publicly available information with the User’s interactions with the Site, the Site can draft standard transaction messages compatible with the QuickSwap Smart Contract System which are designed to accomplish the User’s operational goals as expressed through the interactions. If the User so wishes, the User may broadcast such messages to the Blockchains in order to initiate token transactions.",
  "relationshipQuickswapSmartContractText3": "All draft transaction messages are delivered by the Site via API to a compatible third-party wallet application or device selected by the User after pressing the “Connect Wallet” button on the Site. The User must personally review and authorize all transaction messages that the User wishes to send to the Blockchains; this requires the User to sign the relevant transaction message with a private cryptographic key inaccessible to the Site. The User-authorized message will then be broadcasted to the Validators of the Blockchains through the wallet application or device and the User may pay a network fee to have the Validators of the Blockchains apply the transaction message to the QuickSwap Smart Contract System and record the results on the Blockchains—resulting in a token transaction being completed on the Blockchains.",
  "relationshipQuickswapSmartContractText4": "The Site Operator and the Site are not agents or intermediaries of the User, do not store or have access to or control over any tokens, private keys, passwords, accounts or other property of the User, and are not capable of performing transactions or sending transaction messages on behalf of the User. The Site does not hold and cannot purchase, sell or trade any tokens. All transactions relating to the QuickSwap Smart Contract System are executed and recorded solely through the interactions of the User with the Blockchains’ Validators , who are not under the control of or affiliated with the Site Operator or the Site.",

In making such associations, the Site relies upon third-party resources which may not be accurate or may not conform to a given User’s expectations. Multiple smart contracts can utilize the same token name or token symbol as one another, meaning that the name or symbol of a token does not guarantee that it is the token desired by the User or generally associated with such name or symbol. Users must not rely on the name, symbol or branding of a token on the Site, but instead must examine the specific smart contract associated with the name, symbol or branding and confirm that the token accords with User’s expectations.",
